<p>Thus, in going from recumbent to erect there is 
an increase in absolute pressure below the heart (e.g., 
in most of the body), although there is no change in 
the pressure gradient producing flow.  However, the increase in 
absolute pressure means that the pressure in the capillaries will 
be greater, favoring filtration of fluid OUT of the capillaries and 
hence favoring edema formation.</p>
<p>NOTE: How to think about vertical columns above and below the heart.  
The model system we are considering has a heart and circulation that function together to produce a pressure at 
the aorta (MAP) equal to 100 mm Hg.  While the model is recumbent, the pressure at the arterial end of each organ 
is 100 mm Hg (remember, the pressure drop along the arteries is quite small).</p>
<p>When the model is erect there is 
clearly a vertical column of blood in both the arterial compartment and the venous compartment; the column above 
the heart is at most 40 cm high and the column below the heart is at most 60 cm high.  However, with the model 
vertical, the pressure at the aorta is still 100 mm Hg.  That pressure is regulated by your reflexes.</p>
<p>As we proceed down from the aorta to point 
\"a\" the pressure increases because there is an additional vertical column of fluid of increasing height above 
each point we consider.   At point \"a\" the hydrostatic pressure from this vertical column is 45 mm Hg 
(corresponding to the pressure created by the 60 cm column of blood from the aorta to that point).  The 40 cm 
column that is present above the heart does not add to this because the 100 mm Hg pressure at the aorta includes 
the effect of that column (and the pressure generated by the heart).</p>
<p>If we look above the heart, the pressure there declines by 0.75 mmHg for each cm of height.  
Hence the arterial pressure above the heart is less than 100 mmHg.</p>
<p>Note also that though the pressures change when a person goes from lying down to erect 
that ΔP does <b>not</b> change and that there is, therefore, <i>no change in blood flow</i>.</p>";

<p>To answer this, calculate the change in P<sub>C</sub> that will result from a 10 mm Hg change in P<sub>A</sub> 
(no change in P<sub>V</sub> or the resistances), then calculate the change in P<sub>C</sub> that will 
result from a 10 mm Hg change in P<sub>V</sub> (no change in P<sub>A</sub> or the resistances).</p>

this begins to look suspiciously like it's relevant to the practice of medicine.<p>
<p>Our congestive heart failure patient has high venous pressures (as indicated 
by her distended neck veins).  This raises her mid-capillary pressure.  
Like most people, she spends a certain amount of time each day in an upright position.  
This raises her mid-capillary pressure even more, mostly in her legs and ankles as 
columns of blood push down on her feet.</p>
<p>The increased mid-capillary pressure causes excess fluid filtration relative to
reabsorbtion in her capillaries.  Fluid accumulates in her feet and ankles (edema) and 
she can't fit into her shoes.</p>";
