<p>Amounts of solutes are usually measured in moles.  The number of moles is a function the amount of the substance (grams) and of its molecular weight (grams/mole).</p>
<p>Sodium has a molecular weight of 23 gm/mol.  Chloride has a molecular weight of 35.5 gm/mol.  How much sodium chloride (NaCl) do you need to have 16 moles?</p>
A.  368 gm<br />
B.  0.274 gm<br />
C.  936 gm<br />

A solution with higher osmolarity relative to a reference solution is said to be <em>hyperosmotic</em>.
