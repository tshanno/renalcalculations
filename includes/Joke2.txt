Sleeping Beauty said, "I believe myself to be the most beautiful girl in the world." 

Tom Thumb said, "I must be the smallest person in the world." 

The Hunchback of Notre Dame said, "I absolutely have to be the ugliest person in the world." 

So they all decided to go to the Guinness Book of World Records to have their claims verified. 

Sleeping Beauty went in first and came out looking deliriously happy. "It's official, I AM the most beautiful girl in the world." 

Tom Thumb went next and emerged triumphantly, "I am now officially the smallest person in the world." 

Sometime later, the Hunchback of Notre Dame comes out looking utterly confused and says, "Who the heck is Rosie O'Donnell?"
